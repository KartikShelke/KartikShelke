Title of Project: Credit Card Default Prediction

Objective: The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of credit card default based on customer income, 
age, loan amount, and other relevant variables. This will help financial institutions in assessing the credit risk associated with each customer and making 
informed decisions on issuing credit cards.
